# Climate Change Data Analysis

- Grank Kim and Junlin Wu's Final Project for STAT 5702

- Data: <https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0040205>

- In this project, we will analyze the climate change data from the World Bank. We will focus on the relationship between the climate change and the economic development. We will also analyze the relationship between the climate change and the CO2 emission and other variables. In this process, we will create many graphs to visualize the data and some interactive graphs to show the relationship between the variables.

    "text": "1 Introduction\nClimate change has been a hot topic from many years ago. However, we felt that in recent years, the topic of climate change has been mentioned less in the news, maybe due to COVID 19, Russian-Ukrainian wars, Palestinian conflicts, etc. However, climate change is still a very important topic that we should not forget. Despite being very young, we could still notice the changes in the environment around us. For example, I remembered the summers in recent years being hotter than ever before and winters in the past being much colder, then much warmer, to now much colder again. In the past, we often hear in the news about global warming. However, the effect of global warming is not only the increase in temperature, but also result in unpredictable climate such as much colder or hotter winters, more extreme disasters, etc. In history, many civilizations have been destroyed due to climate change. For example, the Roman Empire, Han Dynasty, Ming Dynasty ,etc. all collapsed due to social upheavals resulted from climate change. Therefore, we should not ignore the effects of climate change and should take actions to prevent it. In our project, we will be using the data from the World Bank to analyze the effects of climate change on the economy of different countries. We will also be using the data from the World Bank to analyze the effects of climate change on the economy of different countries. This will include the effect of climate change on GDP, Child mortality rate, population growth, droughts, floods, extreme temperatures, etc. We hope that through our project, we could raise awareness of climate change, convey its averse effects on the economy, and ultimately encourage people to continue taking actions to prevent climate change. After all, we only have one Earth."

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nFor this research project, we will utilize data sourced from the World Bank’s Climate Change Data catalog. The World Bank, as a reputable international financial institution, collects and disseminates this data under its Open Data Policy, ensuring a high standard of reliability and accuracy. The World Bank’s Climate Change Data is publicly available under the Access to Information Classification Policy and is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0. Related links include more specific data like the Climate Change Indicators and the Climate Change Knowledge Portal.\nThe data is disseminated by the World Bank under its Open Data Policy.The data can be downloaded in XLS format. We plan to save sheet 1, the data sheet first, as a .csv file and import it using R-studio. The dataset, sourced from an Excel file titled “climate_change_download_0.xls”, comprises three distinct sheets: “Data”, “Country”, and “Series”. Each sheet contributes unique information essential for the comprehensive analysis of climate change-related data.\nThe datasheet, named “Data”, includes columns for country codes, names, series codes, and names, along with yearly data. The dataset consists of 13,512 entries and 28 columns. Each row represents a different country-series combination, with columns for the country code, country name, series code, series name, scale, and decimals. The data spans from the year 1990 to 2011, with each year represented as a separate column. This sheet provides a comprehensive time-series dataset with multiple variables across various countries. The presence of numerous missing values indicates a need for careful data cleaning and handling strategies, such as imputation or exclusion of incomplete records, depending on the research objective.\nThe country sheet, naned “Country Sheet” is a supplementary sheet provides additional information about each country, including the capital city, region, and income group. Example column names are: ‘Series code’, ‘Series name’, ‘Scale’, ‘Decimals’, ‘Order’, ‘Topic’, ‘Definition’, ‘Source’. It offers categorical data that can assist in grouping or filtering the main dataset. It has aggregated regions and income groups rather than individual countries, suggesting it provides a broader context for the data.\nThe Series sheet, contains detailed descriptions of the series or variables in the main dataset, including series codes, names, scales, definitions, and sources. It has 58 rows and 8 columns. Columns include: Series code’, ‘Series name’, ‘Scale’, ‘Decimals’, ‘Order’, ‘Topic’, ‘Definition’, ‘Source’. The series sheet is vital for understanding the metrics used in the dataset. It offers clarity on the variables, their measurement scales, and sources, which is essential for accurate data interpretation and analysis.\nThe structure suggests a focus on time-series data for various climate-related metrics. It has dimensions and frequency, as the sheet contains longitudinal data, covering over two decades. The exact dimensions (number of rows and columns) will be determined upon a detailed load of the data. Details about the frequency of updates and dimensions of the dataset are not explicitly stated on the site. However, we expect the World Bank to update their datasets regularly to reflect the most current information available. We do see that we have data for each year from 1990 - 2011 increasing every year."

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nThe dataset will enable the research project to delve into various aspects of climate change over a period of two decades (1990-2011). The “Data” sheet provides the core quantitative information, which, when combined with the country-specific context from the “Country” sheet and the variable descriptions in the “Series” sheet, will offer a comprehensive view for analyzing climate change trends, impacts, and regional differences. The research questions outlined in the introduction will be addressed through a mix of trend analysis, comparative studies between regions and income groups, and correlational studies between different climate variables.\nFor example, our prelimary research question is:“How have greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) or CO2 trends varied across different income groups and regions from 1990 to 2011?”This question shifts the focus to greenhouse gas emissions, a critical factor contributing to climate change. It’s pertinent because GHG emissions are a primary driver of global warming and understanding their trends across different income groups and regions is crucial for policy-making and targeted climate action.\nUsing the ‘Data’ Sheet: Assuming this sheet includes GHG emissions data, it can be analyzed to observe trends over the years. The focus would be on the relevant series codes that represent various types of greenhouse gas emissions (like CO2, methane, etc.). By combining this with the country-specific information, such as income groups and regions, the analysis can compare emissions trends across these different categories. This approach allows for an investigation into whether higher-income countries contribute more significantly to GHG emissions compared to lower-income ones, and how different regions contribute to global emissions. Referencing the ‘Series’ Sheet for Clarity: This sheet will provide precise definitions and methodologies used for calculating GHG emissions, ensuring an accurate understanding and interpretation of the data.\nMethodological Approach: Trend Analysis: We can measure and graph the changes in GHG emissions for each country over the period. This will illustrate how emissions have evolved. Comparative Analysis: We can perform a comparative study to evaluate how emissions differ across income groups and regions. This might reveal whether certain economic or geographic groups have historically been larger contributors to GHG emissions. Statistical Testing: Use can use appropriate statistical methods to assess the significance of observed trends and differences between groups. Visualization: Utilize charts and possibly geographic heat maps to visualize emissions trends globally, highlighting regions with the highest and lowest emissions.\nThe research is expected to provide a detailed understanding of GHG/CO2 emissions trends, highlighting disparities based on economic and geographical factors. This can inform global climate policy, especially in addressing the contributions and responsibilities of different regions and income groups in tackling climate change."

    "section": "2.3 Missing value analysis",
    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\nFor the datasheet, which is the primary data we will use to analyze, preliminary inspection reveals a significant presence of missing values, denoted by “..”, which needs careful handling in analysis. For the country sheet, initial inspection doesn’t reveal major issues, but a thorough examination is needed to ensure consistency and completeness. For the series sheet, ensuring that series codes correspond between this and the data sheet is crucial for accurate data interpretation.\nWe further inspect the data sheet, which is most important for our research. Consistent Missing Values Across Years (1990-2010): Each year from 1990 to 2010 has exactly 3,495 missing values. Significant missing values are present in yearly data columns, ranging from 3,495 missing values per year (for most years) to 1,130 missing values for the year 2011. This pattern suggests a systematic issue with data collection or availability during this period. The number of missing values decreases to 1,130 in 2011, indicating an improvement in data collection. Some countries have consistent missing values across all years, which may indicate a lack of data reporting or collection for specific countries. For example, Afghanistan and Albania each have 15 missing values per year from 1990 to 2010 and 3 to 4 missing values in 2011. Different series (data types) also show varying levels of missing data. For example, the series “Annex-I emissions reduction target” consistently has 233 missing values each year from 1990 to 2010 and 190 missing values in 2011. This suggests that some data types are more consistently reported than others.\nOverall, the missing values appear to be influenced both by the type of data being reported (series) and the country reporting it. The consistency in missing values over the years and the reduction in 2011 are notable patterns. This information could be crucial for data cleaning, imputation strategies, or even for understanding the reliability of certain types of data within this data set."

We can’t see the exact numbers, but it looks like around 10% to 25% of the data is missing each year. This means that most of the data is there, and people could still use it to learn things, but they should be a bit careful because some information is missing.\nBut starting in 2008, something happens, and a lot more information is missing. This gets worse in 2009 and 2010, and by 2011 almost all the data is missing. This makes the information from these years not very trustworthy for figuring things out or making decisions because too much is missing. The 2011 data is pretty much all gone, which means it’s not really useful unless someone finds a good way to fill in the gaps.\nThe reasons for this could be many, like maybe the way they collected the data changed, some data got lost, or the people or groups collecting the data changed. Someone would need to look more into it to find out why.\nIf someone wants to use this dataset for research or to analyze trends, they should be really careful with the data from 2008 and after. The data from these years might even need to be left out unless there’s a good way to fill in the missing pieces. This situation also makes you wonder if the data was handled well when it was collected and stored.\n\n\nCode\n# Select only the 'Series name' and year columns for analysis\ndata_simplified <- data[, c(\"Series_name\", names(data)[5:ncol(data)])] # Adjust if needed\n\n# Convert data to a long format\ndata_long <- pivot_longer(data_simplified, cols = -Series_name, names_to = \"Year\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\n# Create a new column to indicate missing values (1 if missing, 0 if not)\ndata_long$IsMissing <- as.integer(is.na(data_long$Value))\n\n# Aggregate the data to count missing values for each 'Series name' and 'Year'\nmissing_values_count <- data_long %>%\n                        group_by(Series_name, Year) %>%\n                        summarise(MissingCount = sum(IsMissing)) %>%\n                        ungroup()\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Series_name'.

Looking at the heatmap, we can see different Series_name indicators listed on the y-axis, like “Urban population growth (annual %)” and “Cereal yield (kg per hectare)”, among others. The years are shown on the x-axis.\nThe color in the heatmap changes from purple to yellow. In areas where the heatmap is purple, there’s a lot of data missing, and where it’s yellow, most of the data is there.\nSome Series_name, like “Cereal yield (kg per hectare)” and “CO2 emissions per capita (metric tons)”, have quite a lot of data available.\nOther Series_name, particularly towards the top, such as “Ratio of girls to boys in primary & secondary school(%)”, have fair amount of missing data, espeically in the earlier years.\n2011 is definetely is missing all of the values for most Series\nOverall there is a noticeable increase in missing data across almost all indicators in the most recent years on the right side of the heatmap.\nThis pattern tells us that the dataset was more complete in earlier years and has become less so over time. This means we need to be careful when looking at trends or patterns that include the more recent years.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Select only the 'Country name' and year columns for analysis\ndata_simplified <- data[, c(\"Country_name\", names(data)[5:ncol(data)])] # Adjust if needed\n\n# Convert data to a long format\ndata_long <- pivot_longer(data_simplified, cols = -Country_name, names_to = \"Year\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\n# Create a new column to indicate missing values (1 if missing, 0 if not)\ndata_long$IsMissing <- as.integer(is.na(data_long$Value))\n\n# Aggregate the data to count missing values for each 'Series name' and 'Year'\nmissing_values_count <- data_long %>%\n                        group_by(Country_name, Year) %>%\n                        summarise(MissingCount = sum(IsMissing)) %>%\n                        ungroup()\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Country_name'.

Looking at the heatmap, we can see different country indicators listed on the y-axis, like “Zimbabwe” and “United States”, among others. The years are shown on the x-axis. We see a noticable trend here. Some most countries either miss a lot of data, or they have a lot of data. There is no in between. For example, st.Martin has missing values significantly. *Note, this is after preprocessing for missing values based on Series_name in the preprocess, which is documented in the preprocess folder. We also see that 2011 is a significant year in terms of missing values.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nfiltered_data <- data \n# Rename columns if necessary\nnames(filtered_data)[names(filtered_data) == \"Country name\"] <- \"Country_name\"\nnames(filtered_data)[names(filtered_data) == \"Series name\"] <- \"Series_name\"\n\nlong_data <- pivot_longer(filtered_data, \n                          cols = starts_with(\"19\") | starts_with(\"20\"), \n                          names_to = \"Year\", \n                          values_to = \"Value\")\naggregated_data <- long_data %>%\n    group_by(Series_name, Year) %>%\n    summarise(Avg_Value = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Series_name'.

Each row of dots represents a different Series_name, like farm yields or gas use, and the dots are colored differently for each Series_name. The x-axis represents years, and the y-axis represents normalized values, which means the data has been adjusted to compare them on the same scale for proper visualization and seeing increase over time. Let’s go over some of the Series_name: -Cereal yield (kg per hectare) increases over time from 1990 to 2010. This means that we have more harvest within the same area size.\n\nCO2 Emissions per Capita (metric tons): The second plot with orange dots illustrates CO2 emissions per capita. The dots show variability, and there seems to be a general increase over the observed period. This might imply that as a global trend, countries are not becoming more carbon-efficient and that societal shifts towards less carbon-intensive activities did not occur at least until 2010.\nCO2 Emissions per Units of GDP: The third plot with yellow dots displays CO2 emissions relative to economic output. There is a visible downward trend, indicating an increase in economic efficiency; as the economy grows, it produces less CO2 for every dollar of GDP, which can be a positive sign for environmental sustainability.However, it can also indicate that our GDP has risen so fast that it’s making a decline in this graph. This is more reasonable considering “CO2 Emissions per Capita (metric tons)” increased over the same amount of time.\nTotal CO2 Emissions (KtCO2): The fourth plot reveals total CO2 emissions, with a clear upward trend seen in the yellow dots. This suggests that along with per capita efficiencies, the total emissions are still increasing, likely due to overall economic and population growth.\nEnergy Use per Capita (kilograms of oil equivalent): The fifth plot shows energy use per capita, indicated by green dots. This plot reveals relatively stable energy consumption per person over time with some fluctuation. It doesn’t indicate a clear increasing or decreasing trend, suggesting that energy use habits may have remained consistent.\nThe Urban Population and Population growth plot both signifies that we have a population increase over time.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\ndata <- read_csv(\"data/cleaned_and_ready/data_cleaned.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 4192 Columns: 29\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (5): Country_code, Country_name, Series code, Series_name, Income_group\ndbl (23): SCALE, Decimals, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1...\nlgl  (1): 2011\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n#same as before but with Income Group\ndata <- data %>%\n  select(-SCALE, -Decimals)\n\nimpute_data <- data \nimpute_data$MeanValue <- rowMeans(impute_data[, 5:26], na.rm = TRUE)\nimpute_data <- impute_data[!is.na(impute_data$MeanValue), ]\nimpute_data <- impute_data %>%\n  mutate(across(`1990`:`2011`, ~ifelse(is.na(.), MeanValue, .)))\n#impute_data <- impute_data %>%\n#  select(-MeanValue)\n\n# Convert data to long format and adjust types\nlong_data <- impute_data %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"19\") | starts_with(\"20\"), names_to = \"Year\", values_to = \"Value\") %>%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year), Income_group = as.factor(Income_group))\n# Bar plot for income group distribution\nggplot(long_data, aes(x = Income_group)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),  # Rotate x-axis labels by 45 degrees\n    axis.title.x = element_blank(),  # Remove x-axis label\n  ) +\n  labs(title = \"Income Group Distribution of Countries\", x = \"Income Group\", y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart titled “Income Group Distribution of Countries” shows the count of data entries categorized by different income groups of countries. These groups are “Aggregates,” “High income: nonOECD,” “High income: OECD,” “Low income,” “Lower middle income,” and “Upper middle income.”\nAggregates: This category has the fewest data entries, shown by the shortest bar. “Aggregates” might refer to data that’s combined from different countries or groups.\nHigh income: nonOECD: The next category, which represents countries with high income that are not part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), has more entries than “Aggregates” but fewer than the other categories.\nHigh income: OECD: This bar is taller than the “High income: nonOECD,” indicating that there are more data entries for countries with high incomes that are part of the OECD.\nLow income: The “Low income” category has approximately the same number of entries as “High income: nonOECD,” which suggests that the dataset has a balanced representation of these two income groups.\nLower middle income and Upper middle income: These two categories have the most data entries, with their bars being the tallest and very close in count. This suggests that there is a significant amount of data on countries that fall into the middle-income brackets."

    "text": "4 3.1 Missing variable Heatmap2\nSince having 5 different income groups in our category in the parallel coordinates plot, we create an another coordinates plot: Two high income (non-OECD and OECD) were categorized as high income and colored red. The other three were categorized as low income and shown in grey.\nHigh Values for High-Income Countries:\nThere appear to be peaks in the red lines indicating that high-income countries tend to have higher values in these areas. These are represented in energy use per capita or total CO2 emissions, where higher income correlates with higher industrial activity, energy consumption, and therefore higher emissions. Notably, there is one outlier in total CO2 emissions that is very high, and the other red lines are low in total CO2 emissions. This shows that the high value outlier has driven up the value of total CO2 emissions when we did not break it down by high vs. low income. The trend is more apparent now.\nLow Values for High-Income Countries: Conversely, there are points where the red lines dip, showing lower values for high-income countries on certain metrics. This could be for indicators such as CO2 emissions per unit of GDP, suggesting that high-income countries may be more efficient in their energy use relative to their economic output, possibly due to better technology and more stringent environmental regulations.\nAny indicator that includes “per GDP” for Co2 emissions or energy use, has higher values for low-income countries whereas high income countries are low. Regardless, comparing energy use per capita and total CO2 emissions released, we can conclude that high-income countries still constitute a significant amount of the CO2 and pollution released.\nIn order to validate and further dig into our data, we can use the CO2 emissions per capita Cleveland dot plot. The graph provided is a Cleveland dot plot that displays CO2 emissions per capita for a range of countries. Each dot represents a country, with the country names listed on the y-axis and the CO2 emissions per capita on the x-axis. The dots are color-coded, with some dots in red as a high-income country and black for low-income countries. This graph, although very long and hard to see in one shot, it is very useful to determine whether our initial analysis with the parallel coordinates plot was right. As we can see, we see much more red dots on the right side compared to the black dots. Therefore, high income countries generally have higher C02 emissions per capita (metric tons). This means that even if the high income countries can be more efficient in other indicators, they still produce more pollution than low-income countries even factoring in how many people live there. Some of the high income countries that score high on our “C02 emissions per capita” indicator are US, UK, UAE, Kuwait, Luxemburg, etc. A lot of the European countries, especially the western european countries, have high income but have middle high C02 emissions per capita, which is a good example of what other high-income countries shoulds strive for. Lastly, I would like to point out that we choose this metric “C02 emissions per capita” based on the missing value heatmap above, which is a heatmap after removing NAs from the proprocess.qmd. In turn, the missing value heatmap is a good indicator to see which values we should use when analyzing our graph further. A missing value heatmap before the proprocess.qmd has too many series_name and therefore hard to look at in order for us to get a good grasp of which variables to analyze."

We can’t see the exact numbers, but it looks like around 10% to 25% of the data is missing each year. This means that most of the data is there, and people could still use it to learn things, but they should be a bit careful because some information is missing.\nBut starting in 2008, something happens, and a lot more information is missing. This gets worse in 2009 and 2010, and by 2011 almost all the data is missing. This makes the information from these years not very trustworthy for figuring things out or making decisions because too much is missing. The 2011 data is pretty much all gone, which means it’s not really useful unless someone finds a good way to fill in the gaps.\nThe reasons for this could be many, like maybe the way they collected the data changed, some data got lost, or the people or groups collecting the data changed. Someone would need to look more into it to find out why.\nIf someone wants to use this dataset for research or to analyze trends, they should be really careful with the data from 2008 and after. The data from these years might even need to be left out unless there’s a good way to fill in the missing pieces. This situation also makes you wonder if the data was handled well when it was collected and stored."

The years are shown on the x-axis.\nThe color in the heatmap changes from purple to yellow. In areas where the heatmap is purple, there’s a lot of data missing, and where it’s yellow, most of the data is there.\nSome Series_name, like “Cereal yield (kg per hectare)” and “CO2 emissions per capita (metric tons)”, have quite a lot of data available.\nOther Series_name, particularly towards the top, such as “Ratio of girls to boys in primary & secondary school(%)”, have fair amount of missing data, espeically in the earlier years.\n2011 is definitely is missing all of the values for most Series\nOverall there is a noticeable increase in missing data across almost all indicators in the most recent years on the right side of the heatmap.\nThis pattern tells us that the dataset was more complete in earlier years and has become less so over time.

Each row of dots represents a different Series_name, like farm yields or gas use, and the dots are colored differently for each Series_name. The x-axis represents years, and the y-axis represents normalized values, which means the data has been adjusted to compare them on the same scale for proper visualization and seeing increase over time. Let’s go over some of the Series_name: -Cereal yield (kg per hectare) increases over time from 1990 to 2010. This means that we have more harvest within the same area size.\n\nCO2 Emissions per Capita (metric tons): The second plot with orange dots illustrates CO2 emissions per capita. The dots show variability, and there seems to be a general increase over the observed period. This might imply that as a global trend, countries are not becoming more carbon-efficient and that societal shifts towards less carbon-intensive activities did not occur at least until 2010.\nCO2 Emissions per Units of GDP: The third plot with yellow dots displays CO2 emissions relative to economic output. There is a visible downward trend, indicating an increase in economic efficiency; as the economy grows, it produces less CO2 for every dollar of GDP, which can be a positive sign for environmental sustainability.However, it can also indicate that our GDP has risen so fast that it’s making a decline in this graph. This is more reasonable considering “CO2 Emissions per Capita (metric tons)” increased over the same amount of time.\nTotal CO2 Emissions (KtCO2): The fourth plot reveals total CO2 emissions, with a clear upward trend seen in the yellow dots. This suggests that along with per capita efficiencies, the total emissions are still increasing, likely due to overall economic and population growth.\nEnergy Use per Capita (kilograms of oil equivalent): The fifth plot shows energy use per capita, indicated by green dots. This plot reveals relatively stable energy consumption per person over time with some fluctuation. It doesn’t indicate a clear increasing or decreasing trend, suggesting that energy use habits may have remained consistent.\nThe Urban Population and Population growth plot both signifies that we have a population increase over time."

Each line represents a country, and the different colors represent the income groups: high income (both OECD and non-OECD countries), upper middle income, lower middle income, and low income.\nThere is a wide range of values across different indicators for countries within the same income group. This suggests that countries with similar income levels can still have very different profiles when it comes to climate-related metrics. Certain indicators may show clustering by income group. For instance, high-income OECD countries may have lower values on some emissions or energy use metrics, indicating more efficient energy use or lower emissions relative to their economic output. For high income OECD countries, they do well on CO2 emissions per capita. In contrast, interetignly high income non-OECD countries do not do well in CO2 emissions per capita. This shows that OECD high income countries do a better job in terms of C02 emissions. lower income countries tend to do much worse in CO2 related indicators like the C02 emissions per capita.\nWe also see that lower income countries have a trend where it has a peak whenever the Series_name includes “GDP” such as C02 emissions per GDP or energy use per units of GDP. But it lowers on per capita indicators like C02 emissions per capita. This makes sense as these countries have a lower GDP (by definition of being a low-income country is low GDP). They also score high in mortality rate and urban population. These lower income countries also score low on Cereal Yield, meaning they produce a lot less (less efificent) per same amount of land and therefore are not productive as high income countries in terms of how they produce their crop. Due to their low size of the economy, they do have less CO2 emissions amount compared to high income OECD and Non-OECD countries which scores the top for amount of C02 produced (without factoring in GDP or Capita)."

This suggest a very important fact: euro areas are doing very good in terms of C02 emissions. Having no high peak in C02 indicators while scoring high in productivity (indacted by cereal yield) says that europe is doing well. On the other hand, Europe & Central Asia area have peaks in all indicators of C02, including per GDP, per capita, as well as energy use per gdp and per capita. This is interesting to see because the difference between Euro area and Europe & Central Asia is a very confusing distinction. This is why we explore further graphs to look more deeply by country level to see which countries do well in terms of climate change related data."
